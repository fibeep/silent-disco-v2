## Description

Through our app, we are solving a very important issue - when people want to have a party
but they cannot play loud music for some reason.

With Silent Disco, they will all be able to sync their devices and listen to the exact same
song at the same time, on their own headphones - essentially permitting them to have a silent
disco wherever they are.

## Challenges I Anticipate

In this project, I Anticipate issues working with the Spotify API as none of my team members
have worked with it before.

## Skateboard

An application that will create a playlist of songs
 
## Bike

We will connect the playlist to the Spotify API and queue the songs directly from Spotify.

## Car

Users will be able to log in to the app and connect with each other, to listen to the same
music at the same time.


## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Connect Spotify API and Query Songs / Queue 
2. Connecting Spotify API to playlist
3. Build simple Front-End

### Salo

1. CRUD Parties and Playlists
2. CRUD Users
3. Connecting Users, Parties, Playlists

### Omar

1. Create Chat Room
2. Associate Chat Room with Party
3. Show Users in Chatroom
